## Customization Tips

### Images and Assets

- Place team photos in `/public/images/team/`
- Use consistent image sizes (recommended: 400x400px for team avatars)
- Hero images should be wide format (recommended: 1200x600px)
- All images are optional - the layout adapts gracefully

### Content Guidelines

- Keep descriptions concise but informative
- Use active voice and present tense
- Highlight unique value propositions
- Include specific metrics when possible

### Icon Options

- Use emoji for quick setup (üéØ, üí¨, üöÄ, etc.)
- Replace with custom icon components for brand consistency
- Ensure icons are accessible with proper alt text

### Social Platform Support

The team member social links support any platform:

- github, twitter, linkedin, instagram
- dribbble, behance, youtube, twitch
- Or any custom platform name with a URL

### Section Flexibility

- Include only the sections you need
- Sections automatically hide if not configured
- Order is fixed but content is fully customizable
- Mobile responsive design adapts automatically
